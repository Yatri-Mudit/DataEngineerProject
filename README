In this project we are getting raw data from an API. Using Azure Data Factory we are moving this data on cloud , storing it in Data Lake Gen Storage. Then using Azure Databricks , we write spark code to 
refine the raw data. This involves various transformations such as filtering and aggregating .Once the data is transformed, we load it back into Azure Data Lake Storage. This process ensures that the data is organized and ready for analysis, enabling informed decision-making and insights within the organization.
